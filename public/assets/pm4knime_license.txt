TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Definitions

“Program” means a copy of Fraunhofer FIT’s PM4KNIME, which is said to be distributed under this 
Academic Public License in Object Code form only.

“Using the Program” means any act of using executables that contain or directly use libraries that are 
part of the Program or running any of the tools that are part of the Program.

Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

§1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for any noncommercial purpose, 
including teaching and research at universities, colleges and other educational institutions, research 
at non-profit research institutions, and personal non-profit purposes. For using the Program for 
commercial purposes, including but not restricted to consulting activities, design of commercial 
hardware or software networking products, and a commercial entity participating in research 
projects, you have to contact Fraunhofer FIT (pmtk@fit.fraunhofer.de) for an appropriate license.
Permission is also granted to use the Program for a reasonably limited period of time for the purpose 
of evaluating its usefulness for a particular purpose.

§2. You may not copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program.

§3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. You may not decompile the 
Object Code or attempt to get access to the Source Code in any other way.

§4. You are not required to accept this License since you have not signed it. Nothing else grants you 
permission to use the Program or its derivative works; law prohibits these actions if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by using or distributing the Program, you indicate your acceptance of 
this License and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing, or using the Program, to do so.

§5. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other 
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
the conditions of this License.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the 
balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.

§7. If the use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that usage is permitted only 
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
written in the body of this License.

§8. NO OTHER IP THAN THE „PROGRAM“, ESPECIALLY NO PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, KNOW-HOW, OR 
OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS LICENSE.

NO WARRANTY

§9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD 
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
OR CORRECTION.

§10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
